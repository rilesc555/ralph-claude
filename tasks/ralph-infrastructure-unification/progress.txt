# Ralph Progress Log
Effort: ralph-infrastructure-unification
Type: Feature
Started: 2026-01-23

## Codebase Patterns
- Python package uses src/ralph/ layout with hatchling build backend
- pyproject.toml contains all tool config (mypy, ruff) - no separate config files
- CLI uses argparse with subparsers for subcommands
- uv is the package manager; `uv tool install .` for CLI, `uv run` for dev commands
- mypy runs in strict mode: `uv run mypy src/ralph/`
- py.typed marker file present for PEP 561 compliance
- .gitignore uses /prd.json and /progress.txt (root-only) so task dir files are tracked

## 2026-01-23 - US-001: Python Package Scaffold
- Created src/ralph/__init__.py with __version__
- Created src/ralph/cli.py with argparse-based CLI (run, status, stop, checkpoint, attach subcommands)
- Created src/ralph/py.typed marker
- Created pyproject.toml with hatchling backend, Python >=3.12, [project.scripts] entry
- Added mypy as dev dependency, configured strict mode
- Updated .gitignore for Python artifacts and fixed prd.json/progress.txt patterns
- Files changed: pyproject.toml, src/ralph/__init__.py, src/ralph/cli.py, src/ralph/py.typed, .gitignore, uv.lock
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - uv creates a .venv directory automatically on first `uv run` - already in .gitignore
  - hatchling needs `packages = ["src/ralph"]` in [tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel] for src layout
  - Python 3.12+ enables match/case statements (used in CLI)
  - The project had Python 3.14 installed via mise - pyproject.toml requires >=3.12 so it's compatible
