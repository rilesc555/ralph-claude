# Ralph Progress Log
Effort: remote-daemon
Type: Feature
Started: 2026-01-23
Rotation: 1 (rotated at 2026-01-26 12:45)

## Codebase Patterns
- Use CheckResult dataclass for structured validation with actionable fix instructions
- Git auth check looks for standard SSH key names (id_ed25519, id_rsa, id_ecdsa, id_dsa) and credential.helper
- Use click.style() for colored terminal output in CLI commands

## 2026-01-26 - US-011 Completed
- **What was implemented:**
  - Enhanced `ralphd check` command with comprehensive system validation
  - Added `CheckResult` dataclass for structured validation results
  - Added `_check_git_auth()` function to check SSH keys and credential helper
  - Added `_check_workspace_writable()` function to verify workspace is writable
  - Each check includes actionable fix instructions with specific commands
  - Colored output using click.style() for OK (green), FAIL (red), suggestions (yellow)
  - Proper exit codes: 0 for ready, 1 for issues found
- **Files changed:**
  - `src/ralph_uv/daemon_cli.py` (enhanced check command with all validation)
  - `tasks/remote-daemon/prd.json` (marked US-011 as passing)
- **Validation checks included:**
  - Python version (3.12+)
  - git availability
  - Config file loading
  - Workspace directory (exists and writable)
  - openziti SDK (optional, with install suggestion)
  - Ziti identity (if configured)
  - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (required)
  - Agent CLIs (claude or opencode)
  - Git authentication (SSH key or credential helper)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use subprocess.run with timeout for external git commands
  - Check parent directory writability when target doesn't exist yet
  - click.style() provides cross-platform colored output
  - Separate "issues" (blocking) from "suggestions" (optional improvements)
